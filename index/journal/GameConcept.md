#GameConcept
* I want my game to be a 2D rpg game it might be preety hard but I still want to try making it. 
* I think that the objective is going to be fighting monsters until your strong enough to defeat the final boss. When you defeat then you beat the game but you can continue playing, there really is no losing in this game.
* Features that I want to include for my MVP are a pause menu where you can see your stats and inventory. An interactive world, and animation for when you swing your sword or fight something.
