# My journey learning in terminal.
Terminal is hard but very interesting. I want to learn html code. I also want to make a lot of websites and I want to add pictures to my website. 
Learning the terminal was hard at first but now I think im getting it. Its probably going to get a lot harder though but so far its been fun. Chris made Vim seem like the hardest website to learn so I was scared but Vim isn't really that hard, at least in my opinion. Vim is also very useful since it can create files and folders, and other websites as well. So I'm excited for it.
# Math/Cyber

Algebra II/Trig intensified is very hard. As it is very easy to make dumb mistakes that can make you get the question wrong. Its challenging but fun. Cybersecurity has been my hardest class ever. Though now I think im starting to understand it. Our next unit is about Printers which I think will be easier than software. We already learned a lot about hardware and software as well. It was rought at first but now it seems a little bit easier, and i'm now understanding ther concepts as well.

# Project Reflection

### Businesses that I took inspiration from:
* [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)
* [Apple](https://www.apple.com/store?afid=p238%7CseIEs444j-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_714995330286_pgrid_13945964887_pntwk_g_pchan__pexid__ptid_kwd-10778630_&cid=aos-us-kwgo-brand-apple--slid---product-)
*[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)

I mainly chose to take inspiration from these three businesses because they resemble the kind of business that I want to make, since they handle technology and creating inventions for the future.When I went to  Tesla, Apple, and NASA's website they all presented themsleves to be proffesional, and modern, so I decided to take the same approach with my website. I also noticed that most of their websites were  neat and organized, as well as using a lot of images, that resembled their product and symbolize what they do.

### My Expirience Working with WordPress

When I first started I thought that Wordpress would be realtively simple and easy because thats what the speaking geust made it seem like when she was talking about it, and how Mr. Jones made it seem like as well. But its actaully preety complicated there are a lot of options and features that you can choose and when I first started I was very lost and confused. Also you need to pay to have a substantial amount of features. And I noticed that most of those features are for design and making your website more pretty. With Mr. Jones help I quickly got the hang of it, however the only thing that I still don't know what to do is add pages or a menu, so I will have to ask him about that later. (Edit: I figured out how to add pages) Though other than that WordPress was fine to use.
