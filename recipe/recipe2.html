<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
Pizza arrived in Brazil through Italian immigrants who came to Brazil between 1880 and 1930, which is also about the same time they came to the U.S. Before the 1950's, pizza was eaten almost exclusively by Brazilians of italian descent, however since then its become more widely known, and quickly became a national favorite. One of the main things that make Brazillian pizza differ from american is the crust. You can find a variety of crusts in the U.S. However Brazil always has very thin crust, and the edge of it is usually filled with cheddar or another cheese called Requeijao. Apart from the crust Brazillian pizza's differ from others as they barely use any tomato sauce.
