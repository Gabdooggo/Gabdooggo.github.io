<h1> These are two of my family's recipies.</h1>
<a href="recipe1.html">Flan</a>
<p>  </p>
<strong>Why I chose this recipe</strong>
<p>Flan is a very beloved delicacy in Brazil, which is where i'm from. My mom and grandma would make it every thanksgiving as its super popular among the family since everybody enjoyed it. They would also make it on other special occasions as well, however it was mainly for birhdays and thanksgiving. I chose this recipe because I have so many good memories of it and I love how it tastes, looks, and the texture of it. All in all it just seemed like the perfect recipe.<q>Grandma's flan recipe is a favorite family tradition. ;)</q><cite>Vanessa(Mom) </cite></p>

It is cut into 5 not so even slices and more than half of the flan isn't cut and is whole. The flan appears to be seated on a plate, on top of a white marbled table." width="300"

<a href="recipe2.html">Brazillian Pizza</a>
<p>  </p>
<strong>Why I chose this recipe</strong>
<p>Brazillian Pizza is one of the most popular foods in Brazil, and for good reason, its absolutely delicous. On occasion, usually when family came over we would either order or go to a restaraunt to eat Brazillian pizza. It was very good and something that I miss since moving to the US, as the pizza here is so much worse. When we take vacations to Brazil over the summer one of the things that i'mand my family is most excited for is actually eating the pizza. <q>When I was a kid my family would eat pizza every Sunday for dinner.</q><cite>Rafael(Dad) </cite> </p>
